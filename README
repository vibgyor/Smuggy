hi, this is a discord bot written in go for my friend who's planning on hosting some minecraft events he's calling "cubing". soon, this bot will have a text adventure game you can play on discord, using points obtained during the event.

special thanks to bwmarrin for discordgo and Strum355, whose open source bot, 2Bot, i was able to learn from cause i have no idea what the fuck i'm doing.

do what ever the fuck you want with this. i don't really care.
